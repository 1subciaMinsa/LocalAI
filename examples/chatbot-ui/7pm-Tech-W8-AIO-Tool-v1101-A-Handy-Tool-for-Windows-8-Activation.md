How does 7pm Tech - W8 AIO Tool v1.1.0.1 work? According to some online sources, this tool uses a method called KMS (Key Management Service) to activate Windows 8. KMS is a feature that allows organizations to activate multiple computers with a single product key. However, this feature is intended for enterprise customers who have a volume license agreement with Microsoft, and it requires a KMS server to validate the activation periodically.
 
7pm Tech - W8 AIO Tool v1.1.0.1 mimics the KMS server by creating a virtual machine on your computer and injecting a KMS product key into your Windows registry. This way, your Windows 8 thinks that it is activated by a legitimate KMS server, and it bypasses the online activation process. However, this activation is not permanent, and it will expire after 180 days. You will need to run the tool again to renew the activation.
 
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using 7pm Tech - W8 AIO Tool v1.1.0.1?

However, there are also some disadvantages of using this tool. One of the disadvantages is that it may not be compatible with future updates or versions of Windows 8, and it may cause errors or problems with your system. Another disadvantage is that it may be detected as malware by some antivirus programs, and it may compromise your security or privacy.
